# Machine Learning - Linear Regression

# Background

The Boston Housing data set contains information about the housing values in suburbs of Boston. This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University and is now available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Resources

This data set is available in the sklearn python module which is how we will access it today.

# Conclusion

In this jupyter workbook we import Boston housing data and leverage Python's rich linear regression packages to analyze and predict housing prices in a few sample models. 

Basic concepts learned include: scatterplot creation (matplotlib and seaborn), histogram creation, basic use and interpretation of scipy.stats model summaries and results, and finally sklearn. I learned to create my own test/train methodologies as well as leverage cross-validation packages to automate the process.
